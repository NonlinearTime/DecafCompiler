There are two directories of sample output for pp3. The samples-checkpoint 
directory contains files for testing the checkpoint submission.  At the 
milestone marker, only a small subset of errors are expected to be caught,
these files focus on those areas. The samples directory are files for testing
the final submission. All aspects of semantic analysis are fair game 
for testing the final submission. 

In each directory, each *.decaf file is a syntactically-correct Decaf 
program.  For each input, there is a matching .out file that contains
any errors printed in response to semantic violations.  If the input is 
semantically valid, the matching *.out file is empty.
